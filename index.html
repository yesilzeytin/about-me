            <h3>Breaking the complexity barrier: Enhancing quality of service in simultaneous multithreading processors</h3>
            <p class="date">Available at SSRN 5109491, 2025</p>
              <p>Within the wide variety of applications running in the cloud, demands for service quality and performance guarantees need special attention. Since cloud nodes typically utilize Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) cores, processor resources may need to be shared and managed among multiple applications. A customer application that demands high levels of Quality of Service (QoS) may require more resources than its best-effort allocated share. QoSMT is an earlier study that focuses on 2-thread SMT cores to address this issue. While a simple relationship between two threads may be relatively straightforward to manage, the interactions among multiple threads can quickly become highly complex and difficult to design and maintain. In this paper, we extend the original QoSMT study to 4-thread SMT cores by proposing three alternative scheduling algorithms that regulate resource usage between a high-priority thread and three ordinary batch-type threads. On average, we achieve 7.2% better overall throughput and up to 218% better throughput for the latency-sensitive, high-priority thread. More than 92% of 600 workloads display higher performance than the baseline configuration, and 8% of workloads perform ten times better compared to a traditional 4-thread baseline SMT with unmanaged resources.</p>

            <p class="date">MSc. Thesis - Yeditepe University Graduate School of Natural & Applied Sciences, 2023</p>
            <p>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is one of the key performance features in modern processors. However, in data center applications where immense computing power is required, there is a certain aspect that is much more important than overall performance: Quality of service. SMT, though, meanwhile getting its strength from sharing resources between multiple threads in a core, actually hurts the throughput of singular workloads, and a significant amount of these workloads require an exorbitant degree of quality of service. Thus, SMT, which is one of the breakthroughs lying under the modern processor microarchitecture, actually hurts data center applications due to its sharing nature. This handicap even leads the data centers to the point of disabling SMT on their processors to preserve their required quality of service. This topic has been occasionally studied in the literature and several propositions were made to overcome this barrier and obtain higher performance and increase performance per Watt and performance per total cost of ownership dollars. One of the leading studies is QoSMT which aims to enable a quality of service satisfying SMT approach in data centers. It achieves so by implementing a statistic-based dynamic resource partitioning scheme. However, the original QoSMT paper implements a design for two-threaded SMT cores meanwhile the modern data center processors use four or eight threads. When there are only two threads in a core, there is only a single transaction pathway between threads. High priority thread (HPT) takes or gives resources from/to low priority thread. When the thread count increases though, a necessity for resource scheduling arises as well and the statistical accuracy of partition decisions naturally degrades. In this study, we take the baseline QoSMT study, implement it, extend it to four-threaded SMT cores, suggest and implement some overall design improvements and analyze its capabilities for three different scheduling algorithms. We observe that our proposed best designs provided up to 66.63% quality of service improvements compared to the baseline SMT with only a 7.09% loss of total performance in terms of IPC.</p>

            <h3>GQoSMT: On Guaranteeing the Quality of Service Requirements of Simultaneous Multithreading Processors</h3>
            <p class="date">2023 8th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK), 2023</p>
            <p>Guaranteeing the quality of service of a running thread on a Simultaneous Multithreading processor is one of the most challenging issues since these processors allow sharing of many datapath resources, including the Issue Queue, the Reorder Buffer, the Load/Store Queue, the branch prediction circuit, and multiple levels of the caches among multiple threads. In this study, we apply machine learning techniques to accurately predict the instant quality of service of a target thread so that we can transfer just a sufficient amount of shared resources to keep its quality of service stable at an expected level. Our test results show that our proposed prediction model gives only around 3% deviation from the target quality of service level, on average, whereas an earlier prediction model gives more than a 13% deviation.</p>

            <h3>A Simulated Case Study of Smart Grid's Impact on Enabling Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p class="date">2022 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking (SmartNets), 2022</p>
            <p>Renewable energy is a hot-topic for many researchers and companies alike because of the environmental concerns about current means of energy production. However, many kinds of renewable energy sources generate fluctuating power, which is hard to load-balance through different days of a month, or even hours of a day. This consistency problem increases the need for energy storage improvement. In this study, we elaborate on if an IoT enabled smart-grid application can successfully manage energy consistency for households through using electric vehicles as mobile storage means. We designed and implemented a highly-realistic projection for a city of Turkey, Denizli to observe the impact of using electric vehicles within a solar powered grid. The simulation results reveal that the proposed solution provides self-sufficient uptimes more than twice of the standalone grid with uptimes up to 100%, showcasing an immense potential for such applications.</p>

            <h3>Improved Resource Scheduling for Lightweight SMT-COP</h3>
            <p class="date">2021 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering (UBMK), 2021</p>
            <p>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processors target resource under-utilization related performance problems of superscalar processors by allowing various datapath resources to be simultaneously shared among several threads with ease. This approach exploits thread-level parallelism on top of the well-studied instruction level parallelism. However, when datapath resources are shared among threads, there is always a possibility that corunning ill-intended programs may try to sniff on other programs with sensitive information like passwords or cryptocurrency information. By stress-testing and measuring many of the shared resources, this is quite achievable. These approaches are known as side-channel attacks. SMT-COP, a study published recently, is a secure architectural implementation based on resource scheduling that prevents these kind of attacks based on execution logic with a modest performance loss of nearly 10%. In this study, we aim to improve SMT-COP’s resource distribution scheme with several approaches, providing a quite close sense of security to that of SMT-COP while improving the performance by up to 8.86% on the average, over the original SMT-COP design.</p>

            <h3>ShapeShifter: A Morphable Microprocessor for Low Power</h3>
            <p class="date">Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 2021</p>
            <p>A composite core contains large and small heterogeneous microengines. The most important property of composite cores is their ability to select the most proper microengine for running applications to save power without sacrificing too much performance. To achieve this, a composite core tries to predict the performance of the passive microengine by collecting various processor statistics from the active microengine at runtime. In the method proposed in the literature, the microengine, which is more ideal for running the rest of the application, is determined by a migrationdecision circuitry that is bound to collected statistics and complex functions, which are run in a sequential manner. In this study, we propose the ShapeShifter architecture that holds a single out-of-order core to switch its mode of instruction execution between out-of-order and in-order modes. With a simple mode-change decision circuitry, which is bound to only two processor statistics, we can save more than 25% power, more than 21% on energy-delay product, and more than 16% on energy-delay-square product on the average, by only sacrificing less than 5% of performance.</p>
